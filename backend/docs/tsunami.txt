## TSUNAMI GUIDANCE
1. WARNING SIGNS: If the ocean recedes unusually far or you hear a loud roar, move inland immediately.
2. EVACUATE: Go to high ground or inland as far as possible. Do not wait for official warnings if you feel a strong earthquake near the coast.
3. AVOID COAST: Do not go to the beach to watch the waves. Tsunami waves move faster than you can run.
4. DURATION: A tsunami is a series of waves. The first wave may not be the largest. Stay away until officials say it is safe.
5. VERTICAL EVACUATION: If you cannot flee inland, go to the 3rd floor or higher of a sturdy reinforced concrete building.
