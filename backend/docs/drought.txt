## DROUGHT GUIDANCE
1. WATER CONSERVATION: Fix plumbing leaks immediately. Take shorter showers.
2. GARDENING: Water plants only in the early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation. Use drought-resistant plants (xeriscaping).
3. HOUSEHOLD: Run washing machines and dishwashers only when full. Reuse water where possible (greywater).
4. GOVERNMENT RULES: Strictly follow local water restriction mandates.
5. FIRE SAFETY: Dry conditions increase fire risk. Avoid outdoor burning and be careful with machinery that sparks.
