## GENERAL EMERGENCY PRINCIPLES
1. STAY INFORMED: Monitor local radio, TV, and official government apps for alerts.
2. EMERGENCY KIT: Keep a kit with water (1 gallon/person/day), non-perishable food, flashlight, batteries, first aid supplies, and medications.
3. COMMUNICATION: Have a family communication plan. Text messages often go through when voice calls fail.
4. EVACUATION: Know your evacuation routes. If ordered to evacuate, leave immediately.
5. HELPING OTHERS: Assist children, elderly, and people with disabilities.
6. POWER SAFETY: Never touch downed power lines. Turn off main power if you suspect gas leaks or flooding.
