## FLOOD GUIDANCE
1. IMMEDIATE ACTION: Move to higher ground immediately. Do not wait for instructions.
2. DO NOT DRIVE: Turn around, don't drown. Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down; 12 inches can sweep a car away.
3. AVOID WATER: Floodwater may contain sewage, sharp objects, or live power lines.
4. UTILITIES: Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.
5. INDOORS: If trapped in a building, go to the highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic; go to the roof if necessary.
