## CYCLONE / HURRICANE GUIDANCE
1. SHELTER: Stay indoors away from windows and glass doors. Use a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level.
2. PREPARATION: Board up windows or use storm shutters. Secure outdoor objects (furniture, bins).
3. SUPPLIES: Stock up on water and food for at least 72 hours. Fill car gas tanks.
4. DURING STORM: Do not go outside during the "eye" of the storm; winds will return quickly from the opposite direction.
5. AFTERMATH: Watch for weakened structures and downed power lines.
